## Folder structure
Each folder has the code used for:  
- Figure 2: The effects of ancestral population size on unconditional genetic load that is under negative selection
- Figure 3: Comparison of Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD) scores at ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and their flanking regions in chickens, humans, and pigs
- Figure 4: The effects of ancestral population size on a trait that is under stabilizing selection
- Figure 5: The effect of hard and soft selection on the extinction probability and genetic load for species across a range of fecundity values, and mutation rates
